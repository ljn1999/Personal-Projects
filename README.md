File Transfer Via Self-Designed Protocol in C - March 2022
- Used Unix socket programming to implement a server and client program which conducted file transfer with UDP protocol. 
- Embedded packet information into packet strings; designed a stop & wait acknowledgement strategy.

Caching, Multi-threaded Web Server in C - December 2021
- Designed a web server to handle requests from multiple clients; used Mutex Locks and Conditional Variables for synchronization.
- Used a hash table as the LRU-cache with maximum limit to utilize the locality of reference for acceleration.

Dive Booking Application Database Design - April 2020
- Studied the constraints requirements and designed the database schema in DDL with optimization in redundancy reduction. 
- Populated comprehensive instances of data into the database and wrote SQL queries to solve simulated real life problems.

Map Application in C++ - April 2019
- Designed a full stack Map application; used ezGL and GTK in front end and multiple data structures to accelerate the back end.
- Utilized Dijkstra, A* for navigation; used greedy, 3-opt, simulated annealing to solve the traveling salesman problem.
